<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<h3>...or Continuation</h3>

<p>In conclusion, the current form of the ChemSpider API has all the properties of proper Zoomorphism for the developer: it let's you fly through the air in hopes of nectar with the chance of hitting a web and getting your blood sucked.  The API does present a lot of useful operations for getting simple chemical info, but not for doing that much actual chemistry, yet.  As the API base matures, I imagine it to be pretty darn useful for those looking to build open-source chemistry.</p>

<p>The final section of the API, <a href="http://www.chemspider.com/InChI.asmx">InChI and Generic web services</a>, is not remissed in this How-To, but left for the reader to get their own hands dirty with the interface.  It basically covers the conversion of every main identifier and chemical file type, such as from Mol to InChiKey to InChI to CSID.  If you like it, I encourage you to write some python code and help finish the python API to the ChemSpider API, <a href="https://github.com/mcs07/ChemSpiPy/blob/master/chemspipy/api.py">ChemSpiPy</a>, as InChI is the only part remaining on the to-do list of his guide (robot API guide).  Coincidence or not?</p>
