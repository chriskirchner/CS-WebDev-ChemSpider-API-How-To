<p>Many of ChemSpider's SOAP methods require security tokens while many of their REST methods don't.  Just to be safe, grab a token from their <a href="http://www.chemspider.com/help-create-a-chemspider-account.aspx">Registration Page</a> by first getting an RSC ID (Royal Society of Chemistry), merging a ChemSpider account, and extracting the security token from the <a href="http://www.chemspider.com/UserProfile.aspx">Profile Link</a> they mention on <a href="http://www.chemspider.com/AboutServices.aspx">Page Zero</a>.  It may be difficult to get to the profile page from your actual account, counterintuitively, so their link to the profile page may keep you sane.</p>

<p>Of course, before you start casting spells at the ChemSpider, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, or CORS, prevents wizards from mixing potions using connections from different internet domains.  If you are considering a Subscriber Service for your mighty guild of applications, consider giving the good old guys at the Royal Chemical Society a call to get cross sharing access.  For testing purposes, making connections from your local server works fine, granted you have something like XMLHttpRequest installed server-side when using javascript.  While XMLHttpRequest  usually comes with browsers so that it's connections can be rejected by its own CORS anti-browsing function, XMLHttpRequest usually doesn't come with server where it can run freely.  It's quite ironic really, or i've had one too many potions today. </p>

<p>For those inclined for Node.JS, it behooves you to install XMLHttpRequest through NPM (Node Package Module):</p>

<code>npm install xmlhttprequest</code><br><br>

<p>Then later, after you forgot what you just installed, you can imbed XMLHttpRequest in your infamous script:</p>

<pre><xmp>var XMLHttpRequest = require('xmlhttprequest').XMLHttpRequest;
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
</xmp></pre>
